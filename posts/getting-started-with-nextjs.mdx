# Getting Started with Next.js 16

Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for building production-ready web applications. With the release of Next.js 16, we've seen significant improvements in performance, developer experience, and capabilities.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Render pages on the server for better performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints within your Next.js application
- **File-based Routing**: Automatic routing based on your file structure
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization and lazy loading

## The App Router

Next.js 16 continues to enhance the App Router, which provides:

- **Nested Layouts**: Share UI between routes while maintaining state
- **Server Components**: By default, components are Server Components
- **Streaming**: Progressive rendering for better user experience
- **Built-in SEO Support**: Easy metadata management

## Creating Your First App

Let's create a simple Next.js application:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This creates a new Next.js application with all the necessary configuration.

## File Structure

A typical Next.js 16 app structure looks like this:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── globals.css
├── public/
├── next.config.js
└── package.json
```

## Creating Pages

In the App Router, pages are created by adding a `page.tsx` file in a directory:

```typescript
// app/about/page.tsx
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our website!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Server Components vs Client Components

By default, all components in the App Router are Server Components. To use client-side features, add `"use client"` at the top:

```typescript
"use client";

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Data Fetching

Server Components make data fetching simple:

```typescript
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
  
  return <div>{/* Render your data */}</div>;
}
```

## Why Choose Next.js?

1. **Performance**: Built-in optimizations for speed
2. **Developer Experience**: Great tooling and fast refresh
3. **SEO**: Built-in support for metadata and social sharing
4. **Scalability**: Handles everything from small sites to large applications
5. **Community**: Large, active community and ecosystem

## Conclusion

Next.js 16 makes it easier than ever to build modern, performant web applications. Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex application, Next.js provides the tools and features you need.
